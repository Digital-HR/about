# Environments

Digital-HR builds in multiple environments to ensure the quality of our team's products.

## DEVELOPMENT

These environments are playgrounds for the developers. They provide an opportunity to experiment, test, and focus on work without impacting others. 

### LOCAL

LOCAL is a Developer's physical machine. Clients will never have access to a Developer's local machine, but may see functionality demonstrations via screenshare while a feature is being developed.

### DEV

DEV or "Development" is a cloud-deployed environment that matches the Production environment as best as we can, and is a testing ground for new functions as Developers share code from LOCAL with others. The team invites stakeholders who are interested in seeing changes the minute the team feels it's done and ready to test, on the condition that they understand that DEV is bleeding-edge and could go down at any time.

## TESTING

These cloud-deployed environments are playgrounds for our clients. They provide an opportunity to test, explore, and provide feedback.

### TEST

TEST or "Testing" is a cloud-deployed environment that matches PRODUCTION as best as we can, and is clean and free of potential interruptions or broken functionality from Developers testing and trialing their work. Demos are held in TEST. Automated Regression Testing is run here if applicable.

### UAT

UAT or "User Acceptance Testing" is a copy of TEST, and is a clean slate for clients to test in with their full control. It's an excellent location for Training Sessions and Demos to Executive Management or external organizations and groups.

## PRODUCTION

Production (or "prod") is the most-used cloud-deployed environment -- it's our product out in the wild and available for real users!
