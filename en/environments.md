# Environments

Digital-HR uses multiple areas to ensure the quality of the teams products.

## DEVELOPMENT

These environments are playgrounds for the developers. They provide an opportunity to experiment, test, and focus on work without impacting others. 

### LOCAL

"LOCAL" is a Developers physical machine. Clients will never have access to a Developers local machine, but may be given screen sharing to show off functions.

### DEV

"DEV" or "Development" is an environment that matches PRODUCTION as best as we can, and is a testing ground for new functions as Developers share code from LOCAL with others. The team invites stakeholders who are interested in seeing changes the minute the team feels it's done and ready to test, on the condition that they understand that DEV could go down at any time.

## TESTING

These environments are playgrounds for our clients. They provide an opportunity to test, explore, and provide feedback.

### TEST

"TEST" or "Testing" is an environment that matches PRODUCTION as best as we can, and is clean and free of potential interuptions or broken functionality from Developers testing and trialing their work. Demos are held in TEST. Automated Regression Testing is run here if applicable.

### UAT

"UAT" or "User Acceptance Testing" is a copy of TEST, and is a clean slate for clients to test in with their full control. It's an excelent location for Training Sessions and Demos to Executive Management or external organizations and groups.

## PRODUCTION

Production is the most commonly interacted with environment, it's the product out in the wild and available for use!
