# Product Development

Our products are supported through the following lifecycle.

# Product Vision

Prior to any work, the team needs to understand why the product is being created. This can help us ensure we're building something of value, and that we aren't just taking a process and making it electronic.

# Product Backlog

The Product Backlog is a list of requirements. Our way to track the work we've done, and the priority of requests. It contains a list of :

* Bugs : Something that isn't working as intended.
* Enhancements : Updates in functionality or new features.
* CI/CD & Process : Changes related to how we continously Integrate, Continously Deploy or Processes.
* Discussion : A prompt to talk, and make decisions and other items for the Backlog.
* Documentation : Updates or changes to our documentation.
* Refactor : Addressing Technical Debt.
* Test : Adding, changing, improving or moving automated tests. 

# Sprint Backlog

The Sprint Backlog is a our teams workload over a 3 week window. We've committed to deliver the items selected in the backlog based on the priority of items in the product backlog.

# Testing & Release!

At the end of the three week window, we demonstrate our work, further test it, and then release - or learn from our previous efforts to improve in the future.

# Retrospective

After it all, our team meets all together to discuss how we can further improve. We're always open to suggestions, and so honest feedback can incite us to tweek what we're doing. This way our process is always evolving, and always focused on people first.
