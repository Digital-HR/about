# Product Owner

The Product Owner provides organization, and helps build vision and direction into the Agile team.

## "Ownership"

The word "owner" in Product Owner defines the Ownership of the Product.

In contrast to the "Sponsor" this isn't an individual who pays for the product, or controls the organization. This is an individual given authority to make decisions for the best interest of the Product at the working level.
