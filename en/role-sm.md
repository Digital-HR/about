# Scrum Master

The Scrum Master provides organization, and helps build discipline and agile practices into the team.

## "Master"

The word "Master" in Scrum Master defines the Mastery of Scrum.

In contrast to the "Slave/Master" terminology for Hard Drives or "Master" as in control for a Git branching strategy which focused on control "noun- control or superiority over someone or something.", that has caused issue and need for change, it instead focuses on the other meaning "noun- comprehensive knowledge or skill in a subject or accomplishment."

I t's important to note that this role is in a focus of Servant Leadership where they share power, puts the needs of the developers first and helps people develop and perform as highly as possible.
