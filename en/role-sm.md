# Scrum Master
The Scrum Master provides organization and guidance to the team in building discipline and Agile practices into their workflow.

## "Master"
The word "Master" in Scrum Master defines the Mastery of Scrum.

In contrast to the "Slave/Master" terminology for Hard Drives or "Master" for a Git branching strategy which both focused on the term's definition of "control or superiority over someone or something", that has caused issue and need for change, "Master" instead focuses on the term's other definition of "comprehensive knowledge or skill in a subject or accomplishment."

It's important to note that this role is a form of Servant Leadership where the Scrum Master shares power, puts the needs of the developers first, and helps the team develop and perform together effectively.

# Daily Responsibilties
* Ensure the Team performs daily standups.
  * Focus on Transparency and Information Sharing. 
  * The three questions "What did you do yesterday?", "What are you doing today?", and "What's in your way?" aren't meant as status reports or time accounting, but rather a shared opportunity to identify task roadblocks and coordinate their resolution.
  * Note that the resolution shouldn't occur in the Standup itself - it's better to identify the roadblock and who can help solve it in the meeting, then attempt the resolution outside the meeting.
* Work to resolve all and any roadblocks a team member has. 
  * This doesn't mean the Scrum Master solves the roadblock (unless they can easily), but they should always find someone who can and ensure it gets done.
  * Examples: 
    * > My `______` broke and I need a new one today.
    * > I still haven't got the software I ordered a month ago.
    * > I need help debugging a problem with `______`.
    * > I'm struggling to learn `______` and would like to pair with someone on it.
    * > I can't get the vendor's tech support group to call me back.
    * > Our new contractor can't start because no one is here to sign her contract.
    * > I can't get the `______` group to give me any time and I need to meet with them.
    * > The department VP has asked me to work on something else "for a day or two."
