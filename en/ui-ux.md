# UX/UX Design

Design work is an important part of [Product Development](./product-development.html), but is considered 'off-cycle'. Roughly three "sprints" worth of work are required to complete work, but buffer times may be required between Testing and Implementation based on results and findings. 

## Phase 1) Design

### Research & Requirements Gathering

To deliver an optimal user experience, the designer team needs to have clear requirements. These are a combination of the [Product Vision](./product-development.html#product-vision), research and constraints gathered from Stakeholders, Management and Clients.

* What problem is being solved?
* How will solving this problem improve the user experience?
* How does this solution help the end user reach their goals? (Or a specific goal?)

Ideally these requirements and constraints should be based on the end goals of the product. 

User stories and journey maps are a part of establishing and identifying future product requirements, and can greatly assist designers in understanding specific goals.

Finally, evidence and metrics provides a basis for designers to make informed, evidence based decisions.

### Planning and Organization

The designer team groups requirements logically into issues that are based on functionality and flow with a consideration of technical requirements. This prioritization is based on related functionality and flow rather than the Demon or Priority in contrast from Product Development to eliminate repitation, overlap and unncessary revision.

Constraints are analyzed, and analysis of any current in flight development is done to minimize or eliminate bugs stemming from an incomplete flow/user experience.

This holistic UX approach allows the creation of components and interactions for a well-built and resilient product.

### UX Design Process

The design team makes recommendations for changes to the product within the scope of the requirements and constraints. They propose new ideas and solutions if it could further enhance the UX, at their professional discretion. 

### Deliverables

The design team on completion of the first Phase provides the following deliverables.
* Low Fidelity Mockups
** These provide recommendations for changes.
* Mockup Walkthroughs and/or Interactable Prototypes
** These demonstrate the flow of major interactions.
* Client Review
** As with Product Development, this is an opportunity to ask questions and provide feedback for the next cycle.
* High-Fidelity Mockups (If Necessary)
** Are built as prior to implementation to support the implementation by the Product Development Team.

## Notes :

In general:
• Designers appreciate an understanding that the user experience and user interface are separate but connected parts of the process
• As well timelines for building an application with a pre-defined design system is very different than building one based on a new design system (each component needs to be designed and the library will continue to grow as the application expands)
• An optimal user experience requires a well-designed user interface, and an optimal user interface is meaningless without a well-designed user experience
• It is also important to note that in designing an optimal user experience, micro-interactions are just as important as the overall product flow. As well, accessibility considerations are made at all steps of the design process (that is, designing intuitive and accessible interactions requires time up front, but saves time later).
