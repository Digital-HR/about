# UX/UX Design

Design work is an important part of [Product Development](./product-development.html), but is considered 'off-cycle'. Roughly three "sprints" worth of work are required to complete work, but buffer times may be required between Testing and Implementation based on results and findings. 

## Phase 1) Design

### Research & Requirements Gathering

To deliver an optimal user experience, the designer team needs to have clear requirements. These are a combination of the [Product Vision](./product-development.html#product-vision), research and constraints gathered from Stakeholders, Management and Clients.

* What problem is being solved?
* How will solving this problem improve the user experience?
* How does this solution help the end user reach their goals? (Or a specific goal?)

Ideally these requirements and constraints should be based on the end goals of the product. 

User stories and journey maps are a part of establishing and identifying future product requirements, and can greatly assist designers in understanding specific goals.

Finally, evidence and metrics provides a basis for designers to make informed, evidence based decisions.

## Notes :

In general:
• Designers appreciate an understanding that the user experience and user interface are separate but connected parts of the process
• As well timelines for building an application with a pre-defined design system is very different than building one based on a new design system (each component needs to be designed and the library will continue to grow as the application expands)
• An optimal user experience requires a well-designed user interface, and an optimal user interface is meaningless without a well-designed user experience
• It is also important to note that in designing an optimal user experience, micro-interactions are just as important as the overall product flow. As well, accessibility considerations are made at all steps of the design process (that is, designing intuitive and accessible interactions requires time up front, but saves time later).






Step 2: Planning and Organizing
• Designers to group requirements logically into issues (based on functionality and flow and in consideration of technical requirements)
• That is, issues to prioritized based on related functionality/flows rather than the demand for a specific feature (this eliminates repetition, overlap and unnecessary revisions in the future)
• Designers must consider and be aware of technical requirements when grouping requirements into issues
• When creating issues (GitHub), designers will consider present and future interactions. By doing so bugs stemming from an incomplete flow/ux can be minimized or eliminated completely
• A holistic UX approach to designing components and interactions will result in a well-built and resilient product




Step 3: UX Design Process
Once the requirements are approved:
• Designers to make recommendations (only within the scope of the requirements)
• Designers can propose new ideas and solutions that can further enhance the UX (but again, only within the scope of the requirements), at their professional discretion.
• Future ideas for improvement are welcome from the team/clients with the understanding that they will be added to the product backlog and that all ideas must be designed in consideration of the UX (that is any changes to the UX must go through approval process before being implemented)
• An approval process for UX changes (regardless of how small) greatly reduces the likelihood of UX related bugs in the future.
Step 4: Deliverables (& Optional: UI Design Process)
• Recommendations to provided (via low fidelity mockups)
• Mockups should demonstrate the flow of major interactions (designer to walkthrough the mockups, create clickable prototypes or both)
• Clients to review the mockups with an opportunity to ask questions and provide feedback, with an understanding that new requirements will not be considered as part of this process
• Mockups to be approved by the clients (based on the approved requirements)
• Prototypes to be built for user testing (test environment)
• Feedback from user testing to be incorporated into revisions (iterative process) until all major issues are resolved
• Clients to approve user tested prototypes (test environment) for production.
• If necessary high-fidelity mockups to be built prior to production (specifically for a new design system with yet to be defined components)
